# Understanding V8 for Javascript Developers

The V8 JavaScript Engine is an open source JavaScript engine developed by The Chromium Project for the Google Chrome web browser.  It's used in other projects Node.js in the server side.

I deeply believe the understanding behind the scenes of a Javascript engine helps a lot to code much better and performance code and it will help you to analyze and profile bottlenecks.

In this book will we go through all elements that compose the V8 Javascript engine. V8 differs in some steps if we compare it with SpiderMonkey, Javascript Core and Chakra.

As javascript developer you will discover a set of tools to analize deeply your code, analyze and improve it. 

Low level Knowdlege programing language is not needed it to read this book. This book target that audience that wants to understand a hihg level V8 overview.

All the content described in the following pages are based on my own research from a point of view of Javascript Developer.
