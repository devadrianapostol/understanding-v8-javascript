In order to enjoy the content of this book you should have installed a list of tools previous to start.

## Installing V8 

You might build V8 by your own following the [official guide](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Building%20with%20GN) but in order the do things simpler if you are Mac user like me we are going to use Homebew. The last version at the point of this writting was `5.6`. 

##### V8 from Homebrew

````bash
brew install v8
````
Note: if you decide to use `Homebrew` you won't get the latest version.

Once has been installed let's check your installation

````bash
>$ v8
V8 version 5.1.281.47 [sample shell]
> 
````
##### V8 from source

//TODO

### Installing Node
