#### What’s an Abstract syntax tree \(AST\)?

Abstract syntax trees are data structures widely used in compilers, due to their property of representing the structure of program code. An AST is usually the result of the syntax analysis phase of a compiler.  
Exactly, the result of a syntax analysis. So, how this can be apply to Javascript is what we are going to discover now. But AST is not only used strictly with Javascript environments such nodejs or the browser, everything started on Java world long time ago, with Netscape.

### Javascript Compilers and Engines

Rhino (javascript engine) was born as part of Nestcape project as Javascript interpreter, then it becomes open source under the hood of Mozilla. But Rhino is mainly a converter from Javascript to Java classes, but aside of that it has different uses, like as interpreter, then is when AST becomes important in our story.
